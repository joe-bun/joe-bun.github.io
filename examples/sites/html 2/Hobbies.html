<h3>Movies</h3>
<p><img src="./Lab02_Images/Movies.jpg" height="150" alt="http://images.offerpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Movies.jpg?505c96"> I am a big fan of Bollywood movies. My favorite genre is fantasy and comedy.I am an equally big fan of Hollywood and other cinemas. If I could I would have become an actor.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>

Music has no language as they say. In particular I like soul and pop specifically in Punjabi, English and Hindi.</p>

Its more of an innate talent than a hobby. Sometimes I don't even try: I just mumble or just fake my lips moving. Yeah!</p>
